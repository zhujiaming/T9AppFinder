## Suggestions & Feedback

The original intention of development was to help quickly find the desired app among hundreds of apps on my own phone.

I have been using and continuously improving it myself. Suggestions or issues are welcome, and I will update the app as time allows. You can follow the project or submit issues on GitHub.

If you find it helpful, please consider giving it a `star` or recommending it to others.
